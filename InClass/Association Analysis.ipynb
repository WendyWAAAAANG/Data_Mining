    "One specific application of association analysis is often called market basket analysis. The most commonly cited example of market basket analysis is the so-called *beer and diapers* case. The basic story is that a large retailer was able to mine their transaction data and find an unexpected purchase pattern of individuals that were buying beer and baby diapers at the same time. The story is an illustrative (and entertaining) example of the types of insights that can be gained by mining transactional data. While these types of associations are normally used for looking at sales transactions; the basic analysis can be applied to other situations like *click stream tracking*, *spare parts ordering* and *online recommendation engines* - just to name a few.\n",
